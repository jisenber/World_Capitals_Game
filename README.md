# World_Capitals_Game
The most original game ever created - written in vanilla JS

This is a project that I am doing to create my first website.

The reason for so many files is that each one represents a step I took in
building my website. I did it this way before refreshing myself on how to
use GitHub, however as of my initial commit, all new versions will be created on
the index.html, index.js, and index.css files. In short, the index files are the
most current versions I have of this website and all other files are previous
less-built versions of this website. I have listed the order of the versions
below from oldest to most current.

1. form_function (oldest)
2. capital_list
3. continents
4. reset
5. modal
6. dictionaries
7. continent_function
8. rule_bar
9. jquery
10. index (newest)
